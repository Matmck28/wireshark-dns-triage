# DNS Triage Report (Wireshark)

## Summary
Captured DNS traffic and documented a repeatable triage workflow to separate queries vs responses and identify NXDOMAIN responses.

## Environment
- OS: Linux
- Tool: Wireshark

## Steps performed
1. Start capture on active interface
2. Generate DNS activity
3. Isolate DNS with display filters
4. Separate queries vs responses
5. Identify NXDOMAIN responses
6. Capture sanitized evidence screenshots

## Filters used
- `dns`
- `dns and udp.port == 53`
- `dns.flags.response == 0` (queries)
- `dns.flags.response == 1` (responses)
- `dns.flags.rcode == 3` (NXDOMAIN)

## Findings (sanitized)
- Observed standard A/AAAA DNS traffic and normal response patterns
- Confirmed NXDOMAIN responses via `rcode == 3`
- Verified query/response separation via `dns.flags.response`

## Interpretation
- NXDOMAIN indicates the requested name does not exist in DNS.
- `dns.flags.response` reliably separates queries (0) from responses (1).

## Evidence
See `evidence/screenshots/` (sanitized).

## Sanitization
Excluded/removed IPs, MACs, hostnames/device names, and local discovery traffic (mDNS).
